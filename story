Buying a Counch
Intro:
        The box made a loud thud as it fell of the corner of my bed frame. Looking up from
  Ikea's "Black Office chair" assembly manual, I could just catch a glimpse of the corner  after it
  hit the ground and spilled its contents accross my new bedroom floor. I stopped working for a
  a moment and thought about reorganizing the newly created pile of school supplies. I ended up
  moving to step 6 of "Black Office chair". Only until after I had a fully functioning
  black office chair did I finally get to the lingering pile of office supplies. Despite
  all of my work that day, the only new addition to the space was this one office chair. It was
  time to buy a couch.
