Buying a Counch
Intro:
        The box made a loud thud as it fell of the corner of my bed frame. Looking up from
  Ikea's "Black Office chair" assembly manual, I could just catch a glimpse of the corner  after it
  hit the ground and spilled its contents accross my new bedroom floor. I stopped working for a
  a moment and thought about reorganizing the newly created pile of school supplies. I ended up
  moving to step 6 of "Black Office chair". Only until after I had a fully functioning
  black office chair did I finally get to the lingering pile of office supplies. Despite
  all of my work that day, the only new addition to the space was this one office chair. It was
  time to buy a couch.

        I got in my car to drive to the furniture store to look at buying a couch. As I entered the
  store I was greeted by a worker asking me if I needed help. I told her I was just looking because I
  did not want to be bothered as I looked around the store for the perfect one. I looked a few couches but 
  none of them were quite the right fit. One was too small, another too big. Many of the couches that I tried
  out were not even that comfortable, not to mention the ridiculous prices on these couches. I was just about
  to give up and try again another day when I saw it.
  
        Hidden in a darker corner of the store was the couch to solve all my problems. It was large enough
  to comfortably seat three people and small enough to fit into the available space I had. It was stylish
  but not tacky, and it seemed comforatble enough to fall asleep on right there in the store. Best of all, 
  it had been on sale for weeks but no one had claimed it. I immediately told the worker which couch I wanted.
  As they loaded it into a moving truck I stood back with a smile, proud of my small yet fulfilling success.
